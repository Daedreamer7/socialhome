### Pull request checklist

⚠ Please review the [guidelines for contributing](https://socialhome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) to this repository and then go through the following checklist.

- [ ] Make sure you are requesting to merge a non-master branch from your fork. Do not create PR's from your `master` branch!
- [ ] Does your code have unit tests? All major code paths should be tested sufficiently. See existing tests for examples.
- [ ] Did you run the whole test suite through and ensure no existing tests break?
- [ ] Please check [the documentation](https://socialhome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) whether your PR will require changes or additions to any documentation pages. Use proper English!
- [ ] If changing or adding UI pages or elements add screenshots to the PR.
- [ ] If the PR is not ready to be merged:
  - Prefix the PR title with `[WIP] `.
  - Add a list of `TODO`'s that are missing from the PR to the description.
- [ ] Consider adding a [changelog entry](https://socialhome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) to the current unreleased version. Use proper English, reference the right issue (if any, not your PR) and make sure to add the entry to the correct section (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed` or `Removed`).
  - If you are not sure whether you need a changelog entry - don't add one!

Thank you! ✌
