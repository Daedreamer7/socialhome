# Contributing to Socialhome

Want to contribute to Socialhome? Great! <3 Please read on for some guidelines.

## First things first

Please make sure you have some knowledge of what the software is for before jumping in to write code.
You don't even have to install a development environment. Just head to https://socialhome.network, create an account
and play around.

If you already are a user or run your own instance, you probably have some ideas on how to contribute already.
The best contributions come from real personal need.

## Finding things to do

We have an [issue tracker](https://github.com/jaywink/socialhome/issues) on GitHub. If you don't already have an idea
on what to do, check out the issues listed there. Some issues are
[labeled as](https://github.com/jaywink/socialhome/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anewcomer) "newcomer".
These are easy picking tasks for those either new to Socialhome or with less knowledge of Django.

## Logging issues

Contributions are not just code. Please feel free to log not only bugs but also enhancement ideas in the issue tracker.
For issues that have not been confirmed (= they don't have the label "ready"), triaging is important contribution
also. Reproducing and supplying more information on these issues is valuable contributon to the project.

## Writing code

So you're ready to write code! Great! Please remember though that the project already has a vision, the software has
architecture and the project maintainer will have strong opinions on how things should be implemented. Before you
write a lot of code that even remotely feels like it would need a design decision, please *always* discuss your
plan first with the project maintainer. Otherwise you might spend a lot of time writing code only to be told the code
will not be merged because it doesn't fit into the grand plan.

The best way to ask questions or suggest your implementation detail is on the GitHub issue itself OR on
[IRC FreeNode](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23socialhome&uio=d4) channel #socialhome.

## Tests

As a general rule all code must have unit tests. For bug fixes provide a test that ensures the bug will not be back
and for features always add a good enough coverage. PR's without sufficient test coverage will not be merged.

## Code style

As a general rule, for Python code follow PEP8, except with a 120 character line length. We provide an
`.editorconfig` in the repository root.
